First-time making repository and exploring GitHub

Hi friends!

David here - I am applying for Sales roles at Red Hat and want to get to know how the company's products work and what work is like for developers and software engineers.  The better the understanding that I gain, the better I will be able to sell Red Hat products and align customers needs with particular parts of Red Hat's product portfolio.
